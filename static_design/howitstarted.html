            In the 5th grade, my world changed when my dad brought home our
            first PC—a Pentium 4 with a CRT monitor. Back then, I didn't
            understand much about computers, but my curiosity was ignited.
            Little did I know that this curiosity would set the stage for a
            journey that would pull me out of the depths and become the most
            rewarding experience of my life.
          </p>
          <p class="py-4">
            Spending countless hours exploring every nook and cranny of that PC,
            I unintentionally formatted my dad's thesis documents twice. Despite
            the setbacks, the bond between me and the computer grew stronger,
            marking the beginning of a journey into the world of technology.
          </p>
          <p class="py-4">
            In 8th grade, a winter vacation homework assignment introduced me to
            HTML. What started as a simple task to replicate our school's
            website turned into a meticulous project, earning the highest grade.
            My teacher's words—beyond expectations from an 8th grader—planted
            the seed of confidence and passion for coding.
          </p>
          <div class="p-5 bg-white rounded-lg mb-4">

          <p class="py-4">
            In 11th grade, a Sony Xperia Android phone entered the scene.
            Rooting the phone, exploring boot-loaders, and installing custom OSs
            became my new playground. I learned to solve problems, often ones I
            created while traversing the vast landscape of the internet.
          </p>
          <p class="py-4">
            With the weight of expectations to pursue medicine and facing a low
            point in my life, I made a pivotal decision. Convincing my family, I
            shifted gears towards software engineering. This marked the
            beginning of a path I would navigate on my own.
          </p>
          <p class="py-4">
            My father, unfamiliar with the world of software engineering,
            couldn't provide guidance. I had to figure out my path
            independently. The transition wasn't without challenges, but it was
            a journey filled with self-discovery and determination.
          </p>
          <p class="py-4">
            Finally, I started coding. Small projects turned into my escape,
            pulling me out of a metaphorical grave. Coding became more than a
            skill—it became the most rewarding pursuit of my time.
          </p>
          <p class="py-4">
            As I reflect on this journey—from accidental formatting to coding as
            a source of rejuvenation—I realize the power of resilience and the
            impact of following one's passion. Coding is not just about the
            syntax or algorithms; it's a journey of self-discovery,
            problem-solving, and the relentless pursuit of knowledge.
          </p>
          <p class="py-4">
            In every line of code, I find fulfillment, and in every project, I
            discover the limitless possibilities of creation. Coding has been
            more than a skill—it has been my compass, guiding me through
            challenges and towards a future filled with excitement and endless
            potential.
          </p>
          <p class="py-4">
            This is my coding journey—a story of embracing the code and finding
            a rewarding path that I can truly call my own.
